My name is Dieter Steffmann. I am a trained typesetter and stopped practicing my profession in 1966.....
..... Since I consider fonts to be cultural heritage, I do not agree with their commercialization. Fonts once made out of metal type obviously had a price along with their metal value, and the cost of designing, cutting and casting is convincing, particularly since the buyer also acquired ownership of the purchased fonts!

Anyone who believes that they can buy a magazine now a days and then have the property acquired as in the times of metal setting, is wrong: The font foundries only sell "licenses" for a file of nothing but "zeros and ones" with no real material value, and the buyer usually does not become the owner, but only a licensee!

For all these reasons I am giving out my fonts to everyone for free for commercial purposes without any restrictions and I hope you enjoy in these fonts as much as I and many other font-friends around the world do!

If by chance you get a notice that any one of my fonts can not be embedded into a PDF due to licensing restrictions, then you have most likely obtained my font from an unauthorized distributor who is offering unauthorized versions of my fonts.
